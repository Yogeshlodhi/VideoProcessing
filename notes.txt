    codec ( coder-decoder ) is an algorithm/device used to compress
    digital media files. codecs play a crucial role in reducing size of audio
    and video files while retaining as much quality as possible
** vcodec => video codec, when we specify -vcodec libx264,
    we're telling ffmpeg to use specific video codec, and libx264 in this case

** Types of Video codecs
    1. H.264 / AVC (Advanced Video Coding) : it achieves good balance b/w quality and file size.
    libx264 is open source implementation of H.264 codec.
    it is highly efficient at reducing file sizes while retaining quality

    2. H.265 / HEVC(High Efficiency Vido Coding) : Achieves better compression than H.264, but
    requires more computational power to encode and decode, often used in 4K video processing.

    3. VP8 & VP9 : Developed by Google, these codecs are populer in web apps and
    are supported by browsers like chrome and firefox.

    4. AV1 : Designed to be open and royalty-free with even better compression than H.265
    5. MPEG-4 : less efficient

** libx264 
    it is the library that provides H.264 encoding

** crf (CONSTANT RATE FACTOR) : quality based encoding mode
    range from 0-51 => 0 : lossless quality, no compression
